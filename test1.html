    <p><h2><u><center> PERSONALITY DEVELOPMENT </center></u></h2>

    <h2><u>Definition</u></h2>

    Personality has many definitions in general opinions or in a psychologist’s options but personality word’s origin is from Latin word ‘personare’ whose meaning is ‘to speak through’. The word ‘personality’ is a broad term. It combines in itself the characteristics and qualities which give him a distinct identity. These things distinguish him from others. Thus, personality development is not an overnight task. It requires sufficient time and efforts to groom and shape personality. However, personality development is the outcome of so many factors which include will-power, confidence, concentration, memory, and smile, humour, to name a few.</p>

<p>Personality is the sum total of ways in which an individual reacts and interacts with others. Or personality is generally defined as the deeply ingrained and relatively enduring patterns of thought, feeling and behaviour. In fact, when one refers to personality, it generally implies to all what is unique about an individual, the characteristics that make one stand out in a crowd. Personality is the sum total of individual’s psychological traits, characteristics, motives, habits, attitudes, beliefs and outlooks.

    <h2>Determinants of Personality Development </h2>

    <u>The following are the determinants of personality development:</u>

Heredity: Heredity refers to those factors that were determined at conception. Physical structure, facial attractiveness, gender, temperament, muscle composition and reflexes, energy level and biological rhythms are the characteristics that are generally considered to be either completely or substantially influenced by what your parents were, that is by their biological, physiological and inherent psychological make-up.

Environment: The environmental factors that exert pressures on our personality formation are the culture in which we are raised, our early conditioning, the norms among our family, friends and social groups, and other influences that we experience. The environment to which we are exposed plays a substantial role in shaping our personality.

Situation: A third factor, the situation, influences the effects of heredity and environment on personality. An individual’s personality, although generally stable and consistent, does change in different situations. The varying demand of different situations calls forth different aspects of one’s personality. We should not, therefore, look upon personality patterns in isolation.</p>

    <h2> <u>What is Personality </u></h2>

It is the totality of a person’s quality, both desirable and undesirable as revealed in response to the various situations presented to you in life. Your personality is the total impact you make on other people. The personality each one of us has is determined by many factors. The level of one’s intelligence, one’s physical limitations, extent of one’s education, heredity and environment in which one is brought up. It is the strength of our basic emotions and anxiety. According to Bradshaw, “An individual’s personality is an aggregate conglomeration of decisions we have made throughout our lives.” A personality is an improvement in all spheres of an individual’s life, be it with friends, in the office or in any other environment. Personality development is the development of personality cult so as to create a strong positive impression about self with the targeted group. The following are the points for an ultimate personality:

Need for Personality Development
</pre>
<p>Will-power is one of the key factors necessary to develop personality. It is a phenomenon which lies in human mind. It needs to be groomed, shaped and exploited. Concentration, meditation and faith can be of great help in this regard. All the great men of the world who rose to the height of success were men of strong will. All the geniuses, scholars and eminent personalities had this trait in abundance. It was their will which helped and guided them to rise against all odds. They changed the direction of wind in their favour. Men of will never step back in face of adversaries. They have full confidence in their will. Thus, they believe and taste success at the end of the day.

Strong will leads to the development of self-confidence. Self-confidence is very important to succeed in life. A person who has confidence in his work will not give up in the face of difficulties. He will fight courageously unless and until he succeeds in getting his target achieved. Failures and hardships do not discourage a confident person. It is his confidence which promotes him to try again and again.

Concentration is an important ingredient of personality development. Concentration helps in exploiting the potentiality hidden in human beings. Good habit and memory vitalize the efficiency of mind. They help in acquiring the power of concentration. They contribute in success. It is the power of concentration which gives strength to even the weakest creature.

Memory has close relation with concentration. Memory comprises retention, recollection and recognition. Sharp memory helps to retain and recall various facts, figures and other things whenever required.

Humour adds colour to personality. It makes personality interesting. It removes boredom. It keeps his spirit high. Humour lends charm even to dull and dreary subject of life. A hearty laugh wipes out misery and gloom and kindles a spirit to struggle and fight against adverse situation. Thus, adverse situation fails to bring him down. A humorous person keeps himself above all scares and worries. He spreads cheerfulness around him and becomes popular among his circles.

In addition, a large number of external, inherent and acquired qualities contribute to build up the personality. These qualities include integrity, humility, self respect, etc. all these factors combine to shape the personality of a man. These cannot be cultivated within a day or two. It should be inculcated from early childhood. Both parents and teachers have a significant role in the personality development of a man.
